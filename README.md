# User Registration Form with Validation

## Project Overview

This project is a robust user registration form with built-in validation. It's designed to provide a seamless user experience, ensuring that all input is correctly formatted before it's processed.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: This is the backbone of our application. Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and generates static websites for React based web applications.

- **TypeScript**: We use TypeScript to make the development process smoother. TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types. This helps us catch errors early in the development process.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. We use it to rapidly build custom user interfaces without leaving our HTML.

- **Shadcn UI**: Shadcn UI is a UI library that helps us build high-quality, accessible design systems. It provides us with a set of well-designed and comprehensive components.

- **Zod**: Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. We use it to ensure the data we receive is as expected.

- **Docker**: Docker allows us to package our application along with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. This makes it easy to share our application and ensures it runs the same, regardless of the environment.
